# JAXBRestService
A simple Restful service application in Java

This is a dynamic web application that uses jersey 2 libraries. It is maven built application.
This application runs successfully on Tomcat 7-64 bit.

The application might fail to run in eclipse neon for no apparent reason. So, I recommend using Eclipse Kepler SR2.
